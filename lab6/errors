//A list of errors found in the LetterHome program

When an invalid sentence code(out of bounds 1-5) is entered, "x is a valid sentence
code" is printed instead of "x is not a valid sentence code".

When "2" is entered as a sentence code and "4" as a modifier code, "hot" is
printed as the modifier, which is the same output of modifier code 3. The 
output of modifier code 4 should be cold.   

Sentence code 3 and modifier code 3 produces the statement "I plan to come
home for a visit last weekend." This does not make sense, sentence should read
"I plan to come for a visit next weekend".  

"Books" should be singular for Sentence 4. "I have to buy another books for one
of my classes" is grammatically incorrect. 

A modifier code too low or too high for sentence 5 prints "Thanks for the ERROR" 
and does not print out the rest of the sentece(should print"Thanks for the ERROR you sent").

There is no period after setnence code 5's sentence  "Thanks for the ____ you
sent". Error exists with any modifier code in combination with sentence code 5.
